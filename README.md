# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

The "Bootstrap-Portfolio" project creates a sophisticated and responsive portfolio website using the Bootstrap framework, minimising reliance on media queries. It features a user-friendly navigation bar, an engaging hero section with a personalised Jumbotron, and an aesthetically arranged work section using Bootstrap cards to showcase diverse projects. The portfolio includes sections outlining anticipated boot camp skills, an "About Me" segment, and a seamlessly integrated contact area within an elegant footer. Notable design elements encompass hyperlinks with hover effects and buttons displaying a box shadow upon interaction. The project adheres to a structured folder hierarchy and is seamlessly deployed on GitHub Pages for enhanced accessibility and visibility.
